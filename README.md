A node program that uses Playwright to join random games on jackbox.tv. For educational purposes only and ***not to be used to bother people***.

## Usage

In the base directory:
- Run `npm i` to install packages
- Run `npm start` to launch a chromium browser instance and start the program

The program will use a brute force method to find a game in progress, then join the game.
